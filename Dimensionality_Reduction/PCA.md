* Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is by far the most popular dimensionality reduction algorithm. 
> #### First it identifies the hyperplane that lies closest to the data, and then it projects the data onto it

* It Works on Statistical Concept based Machine Learning Algorithms
  * Random forest does not need it.
  * It autometically handles [Multi-colinearity.](https://github.com/iAmKankan/MachineLearning_With_Python/blob/master/Supervised/Linear%20Regrassion/correlation.md) present in data.
  * It is sensitive to Outliers.
