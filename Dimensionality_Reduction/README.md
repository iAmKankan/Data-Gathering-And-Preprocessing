* The curse of dimensionality is a problem that arises when we are working with a lot of data having multiple features or we can say it as high dimensional data. The dimension of the data means the no. of features or columns in our dataset.
The problems that we face while dealing with high-dimensional data is that it becomes very challenging to identify meaningful patterns while analyzing and visualizing the data and it also degrades the Machine Learning modelâ€™s accuracy while decreasing the computation speed as well, i.e. training the model will become much slower as the dimensions increase.


In theory, one solution to the curse of dimensionality could be to increase the size of
the training set to reach a sufficient density of training instances. Unfortunately, in
practice, the number of training instances required to reach a given density grows
exponentially with the number of dimensions. With just 100 features (much less than
