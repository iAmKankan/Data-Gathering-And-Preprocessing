* Data cleaning is a key part of data science, but it can be deeply frustrating.
   *  Why are some of your text fields garbled? 
   *  What should you do about those missing values? 
   *  Why arenâ€™t your dates formatted correctly? 
   *  How can you quickly clean up inconsistent data entry? 
   *  How to fix them!
### Missing Value

#### The reason of data is missing

* This part is better be called "data intution", by which it mean "really looking at the  data and trying to figure out why it is the way it is and how that will affect the analysis". 
* For dealing with missing values, you'll need to use your intution to figure out why the value is missing. 
* One of the most important questions you can ask yourself to help figure this out is this:
> **Is this value missing because it wasn't recorded or because it doesn't exist?**

#### Measures for missing data

* If a value is missing becuase it doesn't exist (like the height of the oldest child of someone who doesn't have any children) then it doesn't make sense to try and guess what it might be. 
* These values you probably do want to keep as _**NaN**_.

* On the other hand, if a value is missing because it wasn't recorded, then you _**can try to guess what it might have been based on the other values in that column and row.**_ 
* This is called **imputation.** 
> _**In statistics, imputation is the process of replacing missing data with substituted values.**_


#### Drop missing values

* If you're in a hurry or don't have a reason to figure out why your values are missing, one option you have is to just remove any rows or columns that contain missing values. 

> Note: Generally this approch is not recommend for important projects! It's usually worth it to take the time to go through your data and really look at all the columns with missing values one-by-one to really get to know your dataset.    

* To drop rows with missing values, Pandas does have a handy function, _**dropna()**_ to help you do this. 

#### Filling in missing values automatically

* We can use the Panda's _**fillna()**_ function to fill in missing values in a dataframe for us.
* One option we have is to specify what we want the NaN values to be replaced with. 
* Here, I would like to replace all the NaN values with 0.

> _df.fillna({'NameColumn':8,'AddressColumn':0})_ 

> _df[['col1', 'col2']].fillna(value=0, inplace=True)_
