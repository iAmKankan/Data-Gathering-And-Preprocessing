## What is Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) ?
![Dark](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12748752/126914729-75e0fed5-fdaa-4216-81c8-719340e80694.png)
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is an approach to analyze the data using visual techniques. 
* It is used to discover trends, patterns, or to check assumptions with the help of statistical summary and graphical representations. 
1. Handling Missing Values
2. Data visualization
3. Handling Outliers



### 1. Handling Missing Values

* It can occur when no information is provided for one or more items or for a whole unit. 
* For Example, Suppose different users being surveyed may choose not to share their income, some users may choose not to share the address in this way many datasets went missing. 
* Missing Data is a very big problem in real-life scenarios. 
* Missing Data can also refer to as NA(Not Available) values in pandas. 
* [More on Missing Value](https://github.com/iAmKankan/Data-Gathering-And-Preprocessing/blob/main/cleaning.md#missing-value)
* There are several useful functions for detecting, removing, and replacing null values in Pandas DataFrame :
  1. isnull()
  2. notnull()
  3. dropna()
  4. fillna()
  5. replace()
  6. interpolate()
* [Jupyter Notebook for the above Pandas function](https://github.com/iAmKankan/Data-Gathering-And-Preprocessing/blob/main/missingvaluehandling.ipynb)

### 2. Data visualization

* Data Visualization is the process of analyzing data in the form of graphs or maps, making it a lot easier to understand the trends or patterns in the data. 
* There are various types of visualizations â€“ 
   * **Univariate analysis:** This type of data consists of only one variable. The analysis of univariate data is thus the simplest form of analysis since the information deals with only one quantity that changes. It does not deal with causes or relationships and the main purpose of the analysis is to describe the data and find patterns that exist within it.
   * **Bi-Variate analysis:** This type of data involves two different variables. The analysis of this type of data deals with causes and relationships and the analysis is done to find out the relationship among the two variables.
   * **Multi-Variate analysis:** When the data involves three or more variables, it is categorized under multivariate.
