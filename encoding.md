* Character encodings are specific sets of rules for mapping from raw binary byte strings (that look like this: 0110100001101001) to characters that make up human-readable text (like "hi"). There are many different encodings, and if you tried to read in text with a different encoding than the one it was originally written in, you ended up with scrambled text called "mojibake" (said like mo-gee-bah-kay).
