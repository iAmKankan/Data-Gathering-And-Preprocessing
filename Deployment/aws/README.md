## AWS Elastic Beanstalk

**AWS Elastic Beanstalk** is an AWS managed service for web applications. Elastic beanstalk is a _pre-configured EC2 server_ that can directly take up your application code and environment configurations and use it to automatically provision and deploy the required resources within AWS to run the web application. Unlike **EC-2** which is _Infrastructure as a service_, Elastic beanstalk is a _Platform As A service (PAAS)_ as it allows users to directly us a pre-configured server for their application. Of course you can deploy applications without ever having to use elastic beanstalk but that would mean having to chose the appropriate service from the vast array of services offered by  AWS, manually provisioning these AWS resources and stitching them up together to form a complete web-application. Elastic beanstalk abstracts the underlying configuration work and allows you as a user to focus on more pressing matters.

This raises a concern that if elastic beanstalk configures most of the resources itself the and abstracts the underlying details. Can developers change configuration if needed? The answer is Yes. Elastic Beanstalk is provided to make application deployment simpler but at no level will it restrict the developers from changing any configurations.
